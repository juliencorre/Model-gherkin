# The one leg of the European flow the browser itself walks, and the only one
# WebMock cannot stand in for.
#
# Of the whole exchange with FranceConnect+, a single request leaves the
# browser: the redirection to the authorization endpoint. The discovery
# document, the JWKS, `/token` and `/userinfo` are all asked for by the
# application, in the scenario's own process, so `spec/support/france_connect_stubs.rb`
# answers them exactly as it answers a request spec.
#
# That one leg cannot be sent elsewhere: `FranceConnectClient#endpoint`
# **rebuilds** every address on the origin of the issuer of the FranceConnect+
# it was built on, and refuses anything that is not under it. The authorization
# endpoint is therefore on the issuer by construction, and the issuer has to be
# somewhere the browser can reach — which is the server Capybara is already
# running.
#
# So the issuer becomes an address of that server, and this wraps the
# application to answer the single path underneath it the browser touches.
# Everything else on that origin falls through to the application, which is
# what makes the mounting invisible to every other scenario.
