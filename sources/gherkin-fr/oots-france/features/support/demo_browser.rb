# A browser walking the demonstration procedure, from the operator's login to
# the identified form, across the two hosts the journey crosses: this
# application and FranceConnect+.
#
# An HTTP client and not a browser proper: these scenarios carry no
# `@javascript`, nothing of the journey waiting on a script. What it does do is
# what a browser
# does — it keeps the session cookie, follows redirections one at a time,
# including the ones that leave for the portal and come back, and **submits the
# forms it is shown**, hidden fields included. Posting to an address without
# reading the form first would sidestep the CSRF token, which is precisely one
# of the things the journey has to carry.
#
# The cookie is sent to this application and to it alone: a session cookie that
# followed a redirection to another host would be exactly the leak the same-site
# rules exist to prevent, and the scenario must not do what a browser refuses to.
